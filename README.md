# ARM Espresso Controller

An embedded ARM modification for home espresso machines to add:

* PID temperature control

* A pretty GUI touch interface

* Control over the local network via the GUI or with Siri

I chose an [Odroid C2](http://ameridroid.com/products/odroid-c2) for this project, but a Raspberry Pi should work just as well.
